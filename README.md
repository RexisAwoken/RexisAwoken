<h3>About Me:</h3>
I don't have much to add here yet but I know how to code in HTML/CSS and JS so far. I don't code a lot but I'm open to helping and thinking of ideas.
You can DM me on discord if you want an extra opinion or some help. I don't know how to code in different languages but I can help with logic.
